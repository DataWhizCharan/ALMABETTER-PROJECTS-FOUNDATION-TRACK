### **AlmaBetter Projects - Foundation Track**

Welcome to my **AlmaBetter Projects Repository** for the **Foundation Track**. This collection showcases a series of projects that I have completed, reflecting my journey through foundational concepts in data science and analytics. Each project highlights my skills in Python, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL, data visualization using Tableau and Power BI, statistics, and machine learning.

#### **Project Overview**

1. **Python Programming**:
   - Utilized Python as the primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Leveraged essential libraries such as:
     - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
     - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
     - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization to communicate insights effectively.
   - Developed scripts to automate data processing tasks, enhancing efficiency and reproducibility.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted thorough EDA on various datasets to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. This process involved:
     - Cleaning and preparing data for analysis, handling missing values, and outlier detection.
     - Generating summary statistics to understand data distributions.
     - Visualizing data through histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to gain insights into relationships and distributions.

3. **SQL Database Management**:
   - Implemented SQL to perform data extraction, manipulation, and analysis from relational databases. Key activities included:
     - Writing complex queries to filter, join, and aggregate data.
     - Creating and managing database schemas to support project requirements.
     - Utilizing SQL for data validation and quality assurance, ensuring the integrity of analyses.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Developed interactive and informative dashboards using **Tableau** and **Power BI** to present findings to stakeholders. This included:
     - Designing visualizations that highlight key metrics and trends for intuitive understanding.
     - Employing best practices in visualization design to make insights actionable.
     - Integrating data from various sources into a cohesive story that guides decision-making.

5. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Applied statistical techniques to interpret data and test hypotheses. Activities included:
     - Conducting hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and regression analysis to validate findings.
     - Understanding statistical distributions and applying methods to model real-world scenarios.
     - Utilizing statistical software and libraries to perform analyses and generate reports.

6. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Explored the fundamentals of machine learning by building and evaluating predictive models. This encompassed:
     - Implementing algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and k-means clustering.
     - Training models on historical data and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
     - Understanding the importance of feature selection, model tuning, and validation techniques to improve model accuracy.

#### **Technical Skills and Tools Used**:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Tableau, Power BI
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn
- **Statistical Analysis Tools**: Statsmodels, SciPy

#### **Project Structure**:
